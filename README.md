## **Simulation and S-Parameter Analysis**
After designing the **Dual Port Line Antenna**, an **S-parameter sweep** was performed to evaluate its **performance across different frequencies**.

### **S-Parameter Results**
The S-parameters (**S11, S21, S22**) indicate:
- **Reflection Loss (S11, S22)**: How much power is reflected back.
- **Transmission Coefficient (S21)**: How much power is transferred between ports.

#### **Key Observations**
- **S11 (Port 1 Reflection Coefficient)**: Indicates how well the antenna is impedance matched.
- **S21 (Power Transfer between Ports 1 & 2)**: Shows coupling between ports.
- **S22 (Port 2 Reflection Coefficient)**: Measures reflection at Port 2.

From the plot, the antenna demonstrates multiple resonance points, indicating good performance over a wide frequency range.
